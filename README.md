Etch a Sketch 

In this case I was just able to use flexbox with CSS and avoid creating the squares of the divs with HTML by hand, I used JavaScript for it.

Main goal was to create a 16x16 grid and then let the user set a custom sized grid from 1 to 100 pixels per side.

I added a color picker to make it more customizable and also added a button to clear the grid.

My next plan is to add an eraser mode and the random color mode.
